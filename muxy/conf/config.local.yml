      protocol: http
      proxy_host: localhost
      proxy_port: 8002
      proxy_protocol: http

## Middleware
##
## Middleware are plugins that are given the opportunity to intervene
## before a request is dispatched to the proxied system (PRE_DISPATCH event)
## and afterwards (POST_DISPATCH event). They are given a reference to
## the current context (HTTP Context or []bytes) and can mutate them.
##
## Middleware are executed in the order specified in this config.
##
middleware:
  ## Request Logger - use this to see what's going in/out of the Proxy.

  - name: logger
    config:
      hex_output: false # Display output as Hex instead of a string
